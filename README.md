# Overview

The **Playbook Buttons** widget is a powerful tool designed to streamline your workflow. Here's what it does:

1. **Button Creation**: It allows you to create custom buttons directly on a record's detail view.
2. **Playbook Execution**: When users click these buttons, they trigger associated playbooks, automating specific tasks.
3. **Context-Aware Display**: The widget intelligently displays relevant playbooks based on the selected record type and associated filter conditions. For instance, if the record is an *Alert*, you may see playbooks like:

    - **Alert - Escalate To Incident**

    - **Create Communication Record (Alert)**
    - **Extract Indicators - Manual**
    - **Link Similar Alerts**
